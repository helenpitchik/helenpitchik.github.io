I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Division of Epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. I am jointly advised by <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/lia-fernald/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia Fernald</a> and <a href="https://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/matthew-bonds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Bonds</a> (Harvard Medical School, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine). My research informs the design of effective, sustainable, and scalable interventions that invest in local capacity to improve maternal and child health and early child development in low-resource settings globally. I have expertise in the design and implementation of both quasi-experimental studies and randomized controlled trials and in the analysis of cohort, quasi-randomized, and randomized controlled trial data. I also have experience designing qualitative studies and analyzing qualitative data.

I completed a PhD in Epidemiology at UC Berkeley advised by Professor <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/lia-fernald/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lia Fernald</a>. In my doctoral dissertation I evaluated a multi-component early child development intervention, investigated the validity of an early child development measurement tool, and documented the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on risk factors for poor child development, using primary data collected in rural Bangladesh. 

I earned a MSc in Global Health and Populations at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and a A.B. in neurobiology from Harvard College. Prior to my MSc I worked for a public health research organization in New Delhi, India. I have conducted field work in rural Bangladesh, Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, and rural Kenya.
